First of all, thanks for make RLSH what is now, a real alternative to other shells, now, at the point.

RLSH is a proyect of all of us, and like that, you can pull your contributions, so I can add it to the source code via email
(assemblyislaw@gmail.com) and via the githum tools (forks, pull request, etc.), hope you and me can make this a little bit bigger.

Thanks for all.
Sincerely, Cristian.
