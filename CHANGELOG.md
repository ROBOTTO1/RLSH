Changelog of RLSH
## Something about version numbers:
The version number systems works like this:
```
Example: 5.4.33 =>
                "big release" 5    => A big release that involves a lot of changes
                "small release" 4  => A release that involves a new feature, like a new command
                patch 33           => A simple patch or bug fix.

```
## Version 0.0.1:
Initial release
